# ROBLOX-Cheat-Engine-Bypass
Esentially roblox has a window check for the Cheat Engine application meaning when it's ran the roblox client will shutdown, there's many ways of bypassing this check but what I did was just suspend the thread that uses GetWindowTextA for their window check.

Pretty sure this is now outdated because of an update to the check? Either way it's very nostalgic for me.

Enjoy.
